This project focuses on predicting NVIDIA stock prices using machine-learning techniques. The dataset contains historical stock prices with features such as Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume. The project leverages SQL for data cleaning and Python for data processing, modeling, and visualization.

How to Run the Project

- Set up the MySQL database using the provided SQL script.

- Import the NVDA_1999-01-01_2024-12-04.csv file in the SQL server.

- Data Cleaning is done in SQL and then exported in the same .csv format

- Before running the Python/Jupyter Notebook script, install the necessary libraries (creating a local environment is recommended) and make necessary location changes.

- Run the Python script to train and evaluate models.

- Analyze results and visualize predictions.

This project successfully applies machine learning models to predict NVIDIA stock prices. Further improvements can be made by incorporating additional features, tuning model hyperparameters, and exploring deep learning techniques.
